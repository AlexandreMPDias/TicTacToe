How to play:

Playing the game is really intuitive.
When running the game, it will open a screen, that will only close when you hit any key on your keyboard.

After it closes, another screen will open. And a pop up with 2 buttons will tell you choose... X or O? So you can choose you the Mark that you want to use in-game. But beware; you can only select it once per runtime.
After clicking on either of those buttons, the popup will close, and the game will automatically start.

-----------------

Controllers:
  You can set your Mark using either your Mouse, or using the { Q, W , E , A , S, D, Z, X, C } keys.
  You can resize your screen to 8 different sizes, using either the { Left/Right Arrow } keys in your keyboard, or pressing the -/+ button on your screen.
  You can mute/unmute your game by pressing the { M } key on your keyboard, or by pressing the Mute button on your screen.
  You can also cycle through 10 different background images by clicking the [chgBG] button on the screen.

Hopes you enjoy the game!
If maybe not in an entertainment way, maybe in an educative way!
